# hybridsort
A sorting algorithm that I made and used AI to translate into multiple languages

It uses quicksort and bubble sort to sort the given numbers and then sort the first 1000 and give them while as well sorting the rest of the digits to provide a seamless real-time output of numbers.

as of right now, it is in -
Java, Python, C++

I'll do my best to learn the respective languages and convert the algorithm accurately and validate its usage.

the initial hybridsort is not that practical but hybridsortv2 can be used in actual real-time cases you may the first version in the v1 branch
