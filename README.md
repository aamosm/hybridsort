# hybridsort
A sorting algorithm that I made and used AI to translate into multiple languages

It uses algorithms to sort the numbers real-time and provide a steady stream of output while sorting the rest of the digits to provide a seamless real-time output of numbers. The first 1000 sorted digits are given immediately while the rest are done in a more memory efficient fashion at the same time

as of right now, it is in -
Java, Python, C++

I'll do my best to learn the respective languages and convert the algorithm accurately and validate its usage.

the initial hybridsort is not that practical but hybridsortv2 can be used in actual real-time cases you may the first version in the v1 branch
