# hybridsort
A sorting algorithm that I made and used AI to translate into multiple languages

It uses quicksort and bubble sort to sort the given numbers and then sort the first 1000 and give them while as well sorting the rest of the digits to provide a seamless real-time output of numbers

as of right now, it is in -
Java
Python
